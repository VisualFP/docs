#v(1fr)
- _Deep Application_ hides implementation details
#v(1fr)
- _Tangled Values_ make it difficult to navigate
#v(1fr)
- Need for interactive-visualizers compatible with every value is difficult
  to scale to general-purpose programming
#v(1fr)
Like a 'no-code' tool, thought for people to avoid thinking about code
rather than teaching them how to
