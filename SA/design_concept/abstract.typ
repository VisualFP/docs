= Abstract
Most visual programming tools used to introduce children & young adults to the world of programming are made for imperative programming.
Existing tools for functional programming lack in visual aesthetics or hide key concepts of the functional programming paradigm.

To address this gap, a visual, block-based tool for functional programming should be designed.
The project focuses on finding a visual design of such a tool and then proving its feasibility in a proof of concept application.

Existing visual programming tools are examined before creating a visual design.
The development of the design is approachedin two iterations:
In a first step, concept drafts are based on researched tools and evaluated using a survey.
Then, a new concept is created using the received feedback and implemented in a proof of concept.

The created design concept focuses on function composition, guided by type holes that indicate the type required for a valid function definition. 

The implemented application proves that the proposed concept for function composition works as envisioned.
It includes an inference engine that determines the type of undefined parts of a function and is built using Electron.js & Haskell.

It is recommended to conduct an additional project to find a visual design for data type construction to create a tool that can be used in a classroom.
In addition, some changes in the used technologies are recommended.

Keywords: Haskell, Functional Programming, Visual Programming
