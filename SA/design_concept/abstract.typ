= Abstract
Most visual programming tools used to introduce children & young adults to the world of programming are made for imperative programming.
Existing tools for functional programming lack in visual aesthetics or hide key concepts of the functional programming paradigm.

To address this gap, a visual, block-based tool for functional programming should be designed.
The focus of the project lies on finding a visual design of such a tool and then prove its feasibility in a proof of concept application.

Before creating a visual design, existing visual programming tools are examined.
The design development consists of two iterations:
The first concept drafts are based on researched tools and evaluated using a survey.
Using the received feedback, a new concept is created and implemented in a PoC.

The created design concept is focused on function composition, guided by type holes that indicate the type required to receive a valid function definition.
The PoC includes an inference engine that determines the type of undefined parts of a function and is built using Electron.js & Haskell.

The PoC proves that the proposed concept for function composition works as envisioned.
To create a visual tool that can be used in a classroom, it is recommended to conduct an additional project to find a visual design for data type construction.
In addition, some changes in the used technologies are recommended.

Keywords: Haskell, Functional Programming, Visual Programming
