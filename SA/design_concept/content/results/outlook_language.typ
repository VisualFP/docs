= Visual and Textual Language

The function editor shown in the  #ac("PoC") application could be extended
into a language that can be viewed, edited, and executed in both a visual and
textual fashion simultaneously.

One could imagine a dedicated application for such an environment, but a web
application or an extension for existing editors could also be implemented. A
Visual Studio Code extension mockup can be seen in @vscode-visual-textual to
illustrate the idea.

The advantage of such an approach is that learners can build an understanding
of functional concepts graphically and then have a clear learning path
into code.
