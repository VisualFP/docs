= Design Concept <result-concept>

The design concept described in @design_proposal_iteration_2 and
@design_decision focuses on visual function composition. It proposes a function
editor that features all the basic functionalities needed to create functional
applications in a block-based fashion.

The editor allows learners to approach functional programming through blocks
instead of code. The type-inference engine offers much guidance, especially
the automatically generated type-holes, which can help to understand how e.g.
parametric polymorphism or currying works. 

But other aspects not covered in the concept are also essential to create modern
functional programs. For example, a robust type system with support for sum
types, type classes, etc., can be found in most current functional programming
languages.

Given that the project's goal is to allow beginners to approach functional
programming more easily, the concept should also address a clear transition to
code-based programming. One possibility to integrate this idea has been
described in a possible outlook in @outlook-visual-textual.
