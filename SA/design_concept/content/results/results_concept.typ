= Design Concept
The design concept described in @design_proposal_iteration_2 and @design_specification is focused on function composition.
The described concept supports the most important concepts required to construct functions:
- Function application
- Lambda functions
- Higher-Order functions
- Currying
- Recursion

While function composition was the focus of this project, data type construction is an important part of creating functional programs.
To include this into the existing design concept, the following needs to be defined by a future project:
- A design concept for the construction of sum types
- Block values for constructing a data type in a function
