The goal of this term paper is to design a tool, VisualFP, that allows the
graphical development of functional code, is block-based and extensible. The
target audience of VisualFP are students learning to program. Additionally,
VisualFP should offer support for experienced programmers that want to view
their code in a visual context.

The core functionality of VisualFP will be implemented in a #ac("PoC") to
proof the feasibility of the design.

The main part of this paper is to transparently document the design process
that was used to create VisualFP. This allows others to better understand
the decisions that have been made, which alternatives were considered, and
to evaluate for themselves whether they want to follow the same path.
