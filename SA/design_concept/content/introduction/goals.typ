With VisualFP we want to design a tool that allows graphical development of
functional code, is block-based and extensible. The primary audience are
students learning to program, and secondary the audience are programmers
that want to view their code in a visual context.

Futhermore we want to implement part of the core functionality in a
#ac("PoC") to proof the feasibility of the design.

Finally, we want to transparently document the design process that was used
to create VisualFP. This allows potential implementers to better understand
the decisions that have been made, which alternatives were considered, and
evaluate for themselfes whether they want to follow the same paths.
