The goal of this term paper is to design a tool, VisualFP, that allows the
graphical development of functional code, is block-based and extensible. The
target audience of VisualFP are students learning to program. Additionally,
VisualFP should support experienced programmers who want to view
their code in a visual context.

The core functionality of VisualFP will be implemented in a #ac("PoC") to
proof the feasibility of the design.

The central part of this paper is to document the design process
used to create VisualFP transparently. This allows others to better understand 
the decisions, which alternatives were considered, and
to evaluate whether they want to follow the same path.
