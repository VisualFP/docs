= Goals <goals>

The goal of this student research project is to design a tool, VisualFP, that allows the
graphical development of functional code and is block-based.
The target audience of VisualFP are students learning to program.

Due to the time constraints of this project, the goals deviate from the initial task description in @appendix_task_description.
While support for experienced programmers who want to view
their code in a visual context is included in @functional_requirements, interoperability with Haskell isn't a goal for this project.
In addition, the #ac("PoC") is treated as a sample application to prove that the design concept works and not necessarily as a starting point for fully implementing the VisualFP application.

The core functionality of VisualFP will be implemented in a #ac("PoC") to
prove the feasibility of the design.

The central part of this project is to document the design process used to
create VisualFP transparently to allow others to understand better the decisions
made during the project, which alternatives were considered, and to evaluate
whether they want to follow the same path.
