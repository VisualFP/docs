For the imperative programming paradigm there are block-based programming
tools that enable a purely visual introduction to programming. Many common
beginner mistakes, such as trying to compile code with incorrect syntax, are
not possible in such an environment. Examples include Scratch, developed by
MIT, and LEGO Mindstorms software.

There aren't any similar tools available to teach functional programming,
which is why most educators start their courses by either showing the
logical nature of functional programming through e.g. the lambda calculus,
or by jumping right into code, leaving many students puzzled.

Some visual approaches to functional programming do exist though, some of
which are covered in @existing_tools. Unfortunately, none are not suitable
as introduction to general purpose functional programming.

Block-based tools don't need to be limited to education: A sufficiently
powerful environment which allows conversion to and from a text-based
programming language could also see adoption among professionals looking for
ways to visualize their code.
