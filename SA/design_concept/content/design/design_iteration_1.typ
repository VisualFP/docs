= First Design Iteration <design-iteration-1>

For the first iteration, multiple design directions were created and evaluated.
The following process was chosen to gain as much insight as possible:

1. @design-evaluation-criteria defines a set of evaluation criteria to compare
   the designs in the form of a questionnaire.

2. Then, three proposals are presented: A Flo-based design in
   @flo-inspired-design, a Scratch-based design in @scratch-inspired-design, and
   a design inspired by the Haskell function notation in
   @haskell-function-notation-inspired-design.

3. The three designs are filled into a questionnaire and handed a selected survey group.
   The feedback is then further discussed in @iteration-1-conclusion.
