= Decision

During the first iteration we explored different directions and got very
valuable feedback through the questionnaire. The proposal of Prof. Dr.
Farhad Mehta in the second iteration took some of these concepts, some of
the acquired feedback and combined them together with new ideas into a
coherent design.

Thus, we have decided to go ahead with the proposal of Prof. Dr. Farhad
Mehta.

Regarding the two open questions, we have decided to not yet make a final
decision yet. While we do have preferences, we are going to explore all
options in the later stages of the project.
