= Design Conclusion

During the first iteration, three very different approaches were explored.
Valuable feedback was gained on their advantages and shortcomings through a
survey. Prof. Dr. Farhad Mehta proposed a new design concept in the second
iteration based on that feedback and some new ideas.

This new concept has the potential to provide beginners with more guidance
during function composition than the previous concepts, which is why it is
developed further for the rest of the project.
