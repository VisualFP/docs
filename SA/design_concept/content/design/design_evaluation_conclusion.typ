= Conclusion

During the first iteration, three very different approache were explored.
Through a survey, we gained very valuable feedback on their advantages and
shortcommings. Based on that feedback and some new ideas, Prof. Dr. Farhad
Mehta proposed a new design concept in the second iteration.

This new concept has the potential to provide beginners with more guidance
during function composition than the previous concepts, which is why it is
developed further in the next chapter and then implemented in a proof of
concept.

The two questions that were left open will be addressed during the later
stages of the project.
