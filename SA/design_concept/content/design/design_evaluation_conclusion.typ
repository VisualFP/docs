= Conclusion

During the first iteration we explored different directions and got very
valuable feedback through the questionnaire. The proposal of Prof. Dr.
Farhad Mehta in the second iteration took some of these concepts, some of
the acquired feedback and combined them together with new ideas into a
coherent design.

We feel that we have gained enough understanding of the domain, as well as a
design concept that is worth pursuing. Thus, we will continue to work on the
proposal as described in @design_proposal_iteration_2 during the next phases
of the project.

The two questions that were left open will be addressed during the later
stages.
