= Design Evaluation <design-evaluation>

The evaluation of possible designs for function and type composition is conducted in iterations.
After creating initial design proposals, a group of students and experienced programmers is asked for feedback on these proposals, as documented in @design_eval_questionnaire.
Based on that feedback, a new design proposal that aims to fix the shortcommings of the previous ones is created.

The following sections describe each design proposals from every iteration.
