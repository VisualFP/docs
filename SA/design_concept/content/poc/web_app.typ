= Web Application
A web application has a frontend and a backend.
The frontend is statically served to the user in a web browser and communicates via an API with the backend, which is hosted on a server.

Pros:
- Frontend and backend can be written in entirely different programming languages
- JavaScript has a wide range of libraries available for frontend development

Cons:
- JavaScript has a weak type-system
- The backend would have to organize VisualFP project files for multiple users on a server
- Backend needs to be hosted on a server to run the application
