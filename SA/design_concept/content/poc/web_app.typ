= Web Application
A web application has a frontend and a backend.
The frontend is statically served to the user in a web browser and communicates via an API with the backend, which is hosted on a server.

Pros:
- Frontend and backend can be written in entirely different programming languages.
- Users don't have to install anything on their devices.
- There is no need to support different operating systems, since every device can use a web application.

Cons:
- The backend would have to organize VisualFP project files for multiple users on a server.
- The backend needs to be hosted on a server to run the application
