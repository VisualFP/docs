= Desktop Application
A desktop application can be installed on the user's device with one installer.
Both the frontend and backend are executed on the user's device.

Pros:
- A desktop-app doesn't require infrastructure to host it.
- A desktop-app gives access to the local file system, allowing VisualFP to manage project files on the disk and use other development tools, such as Cabal #footnote("https://www.haskell.org/cabal/").

Cons:
- Every user has to install the application themselves.
- The application must be built per operating system.
