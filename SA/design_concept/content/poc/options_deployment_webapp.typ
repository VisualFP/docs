= Web Application

A web application has a frontend and a backend.
The frontend is statically served to the user in a web browser and communicates through an API with the backend, which is hosted on a server.

Pros:
- Frontend and backend can be written in entirely different programming languages.
- Users don't have to install anything on their devices.
- There is no need to support different operating systems, since most devices can run a web browser.

Cons:
- The backend needs to organize VisualFP source files for multiple users at the same time.
- The backend needs to be hosted on a server.
