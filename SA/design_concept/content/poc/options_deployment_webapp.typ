= Web Application

A web application has a frontend and a backend.
The frontend is statically served to the user in a web browser and communicates
through an #ac("API") with the backend hosted on a server.

The advantages are that the frontend and backend can be written in entirely
different programming languages, that the users don't have to install anything
on their devices, and that there is no need to support multiple operating
systems explicitly since most devices can run a web browser.

The drawbacks are that the application must be hosted on a server and other
development tools that may require access to the users' device cannot be used.
