= Web Application

A web application has a front end and a back end.
The front end is statically served to the user in a web browser and communicates
through an #ac("API") with the backend hosted on a server.

The advantages are that the front end and back end can be written in entirely
different programming languages, that the users don't have to install anything
on their devices, and that there is no need to support multiple operating
systems explicitly since most devices can run a web browser.

The drawbacks are that the back end would be responsible for managing the users
files, and the application must be hosted on a server.
