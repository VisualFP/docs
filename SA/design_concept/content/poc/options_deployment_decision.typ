= Deployment Decision

We expected that VisualFP would primarily be used in classrooms. Such
environments often do not allow for easy deployment and maintenance of
application servers.

Thus, the decision has been made to develop VisualFP as a desktop application.
Given modern technologies such as @option-electron, this doesn't require us to
disregard web targets for the UI framework.
