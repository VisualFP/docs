= Scope

The goal of the #ac("PoC") application is to show that the visual concept described in
@design-iteration-2 works.

To show that, the #ac("PoC") needs to implement
- UC1 - Simple function composition
- UC3 - Function composition using lists
- UC4 - Function composition using higher-order functions
- UC5 - Curried Functions
- UC6 - Recursive function composition
as described in @use-cases.

Although all other described use cases are integral to a fully functioning
visual editor for functional programming as well, they are not included in the
#ac("PoC") due to time constraints.
