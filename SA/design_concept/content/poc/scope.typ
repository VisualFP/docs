= Scope
The goal of the PoC application is to show that the visual concept described in @design_proposal_iteration_2 and @design_specification works.
To show that, the PoC needs to implement
- UC1 - Simple function composition
- UC3 - Function composition using lists
- UC4 - Funtion composition using higher-order functions
- UC5 - Curied Functions
- UC6 - Recursive function composition
as described in @use-cases.
Additionally, a concept for function execution is described theoretically.

All other described use-cases, although they're all an integral part of a fully functioning visual editor for functional programming, are not included in the PoC due to time constraints.
