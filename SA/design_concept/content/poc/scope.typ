= Scope

The goal of the PoC application is to show that the visual concept described in
@design_proposal_iteration_2 and @design_decision works.

To show that, the PoC needs to implement
- UC1 - Simple function composition
- UC3 - Function composition using lists
- UC4 - Funtion composition using higher-order functions
- UC5 - Curied Functions
- UC6 - Recursive function composition
as described in @use-cases.
Additionally, a concept for function execution is described theoretically.

Although all other described use cases are integral to a fully functioning
visual editor for functional programming as well, they are not included in the
PoC due to time constraints.
