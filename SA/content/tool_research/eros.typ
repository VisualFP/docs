= Eros

Conal Elliott developed a way to visualize pure values in an interactive and
composable way. He called this technique "Tangible Functional Programming"
@Elliot_2007. The intention of the technique is to create applications that
allow non-technical people to create content based on combinations of pure
values. 

At the core of the technique are _tangible values_, which are pure values,
including functions, that can be visualized and composed with other tangible
values through a graphical user interface.

In order to combine such values, a set of algebras is defined that allows to
extract values from nested functions and tuples called _deep application_.

Along with the technique, Conal developed an application called Eros that
implement this technique. Eros is particuarly suited to creative people with an
artistic interest.

"Tangible Functional Programming" is a very interesting technique, and
particularly the way Eros visualized pure values can be an inspiration for
VisualFP. Ultimately, we feel like the technique is not well suited for general
purpose functional programming and education.
