= Snap!

Snap! is a block-based programming tool developed by Berkeley University.
The tool allows users to create imperative programs in a Scratch-like manner.
A user can create programs to control a cursor in a graphical environment, e.g. setting the cursor to a certain position and drawing a line.
For that, Snap! offers various pre-defined commands like basic arithmetic operations, cursor-, pen- & sound-controls and some flow controls like "if" blocks.
For lists, snap offers some control-blocks that allow users to work with lists in a functional manner.
However, everything else can only be done in an imperative way, making the functional aspects more of an additional feature than a core concept of Snap!.
A user can also create their own block-commands based on already existing commands. This allows users to re-use their code.
But other than with actual functions, custom-blocks aren't able to take arguments from their caller.

Regarding usability, Snap! isn't very difficult to understand, but also not very intuitive,
which is mostly due to some icons and command names that aren't obvious in their meaning.
