= Time Tracking

The amount of time available for the project was calculated as follows:

$
30 "hours per ECTS point" times 8 "ECTS points per member" &= 240 "hours per member" \
240 "hours per member" times 2 "members" &= 480 "hours"
$

Both members tracked their time on the project each week, totaling
approximately the available hours. A detailed graphic is shown in
@time-tracking-table.

It is to be noted that some work went into the project before the semester began,
i.e., the definition of the project's task description. @time-tracking-table depicts
this as Week 0.
