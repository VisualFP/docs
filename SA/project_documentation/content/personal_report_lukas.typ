Outside of the FP lecture, I didn't have many opportunities to look at functional programming in more detail or build an actual application with a functional programming language.
So I was very happy to be able to broaden my knowledge in functional programming with such an interesting project.

The project itself proved to be a challenge.
Finding a good visual representation for functions was more difficult than I expected.
Not having a satisfying visual concept at about half-time caused some anxiety on my part, about whether we are going to be able to build a good PoC application in time.
But thanks to the valuable input from Prof. Dr. Farhad Mehta, we were able to create a concept, that has the potential to help beginners get started with functional programming.

Since I've never done a project like this before, I underestimated how much you can achieve in just a few weeks.
In the PoC application, we were able to include a lot more features than I first expected.
So, given the time we had available to build the PoC application, I'm very happy with the result.
However, I'm a bit disappointed that I couldn't build the UI using FRP.

The cooperation with Jann went very well.
I think we found a good balance of communication, so that everyone knows what to do, without discussing every detail.

Overall, I'm happy with both the result of the project and how we got there.
I think we don't have to make any fundamental changes in the way we work for our bachelor thesis.
