= Project Plan
We plan our project in Jira. At the start of the project, we created an initial, rough plan.
This project plan isn't meant to give us fixed deadlines but to give us a progress indication at later stages of the project.
In case we realize that the initial plan doesn't work for some reason, it is possible to adjust it.
Our detail planing is done week by week using a Kanban board in Jira.
