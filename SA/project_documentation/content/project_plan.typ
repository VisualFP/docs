= Project Plan
At the start of our project we created a rough plan, which can be seen in @project_plan.
The intention of that plan is to give us a progress indication at later stages of the project and not to set fixed deadlines.
The plan is reflected with the timeline feature of our Jira project.
Our detail planing is done week by week using a Kanban board in Jira.
