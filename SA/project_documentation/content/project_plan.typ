= Project Plan <project_plan>

At the start of our project, we created a rough plan, which can be seen in @initial_project_plan.
That plan intends to indicate progress at later stages of the project and not to set fixed deadlines.
The plan is reflected in the timeline feature of our Jira project.
Our detailed planing is done weekly using a Kanban board in Jira.

== Project Plan Retrospection
The project plan that we defined at the start of the project worked out well.
In mid-November, we switched from the conceptual phase to the PoC phase, which is consistent with the initial plan.
Towards the end of the conceptual phase, we were unsure if the remaining time was enough to build a presentable PoC application.
But due to unexpectedly swift progress, we were able to include more features in the PoC than initially thought.

We met both project deadlines, for the brochure abstract and the final submission.
We could even hand in the brochure abstract about half a week in advance.

However, the end-phase of the project wasn't accurately displayed in the initial project plan.
While we finished the concept documentation, i.e., the description of the theoretical concept for function composition, as planned, we didn't include a phase to finish the rest of the documentation, i.e., documenting the PoC, the project documentation, proofreading, etc.
We did this documentation work during the last 1.5 weeks of the PoC phase.
In a next project, we would definitely include another documentation phase at the end of the project in the initial plan.
