= Project Plan <project_plan>

At the start of our project, we created a rough plan, which can be seen in @initial_project_plan.
That plan intends to indicate progress at later stages of the project and not to set fixed deadlines.
The plan is reflected in the timeline feature of our Jira project.
Our detailed planing is done weekly using a Kanban board in Jira.
