Even before studying at #ac("OST"), I was interested in functional
programming. I worked on some small personal projects in F\# and looked at
foundational topics such as the lambda-calculus.

Unfortunately, I've never had the chance to use functional programming to
realize a large project. Thus, I very much looked forward to working on this
topic, and retrospectively, the project met these expectations. I am happy that
I have chosen a functional direction for the student research project and value
the experience I gained.

Thinking about how functional concepts can be translated into visualizations was
interesting, although I enjoyed the implementation work for the proof of concept
more. After the first few proposals, I was eager to start programming,
but spending more time to think about the fundamentals was valuable and led to a
better result. I liked creating the first iterations of the inference engine in
the application the most since it was both challenging to implement and intriguing
from a theoretical point of view.

The project management worked out well, which is surprising because, in the
middle of the project, I expected time to run tight for the proof of concept.
Luckily, this didn't turn out to be accurate, and we delivered an application that
even exceeded my initial expectations.

As expected, we were able to work well together as a team. Since we are
both part-time students, a lot of asynchronous communication was required, which
can be challenging, but it worked out for us. I am glad we can repeat this
setup for the bachelor's thesis.

Overall, I enjoyed working on the project and am happy with the results.
