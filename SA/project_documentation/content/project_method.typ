= Project Management Method

Using Scrum for this project isn't an option since that would require a massive amount of meetings that don't make sense for a project with just two people.
The waterfall model seems suitable since the project must be completed within a fixed timeframe.
To account for the conceptual nature of the project, we've decided on the phases of initiation, analysis, design, and construction (of the PoC).

We also don't define any fixed milestones. Instead, we define a project plan in @project_plan that roughly places the phases mentioned above in the available time frame for the project.
