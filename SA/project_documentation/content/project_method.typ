= Project Management Method

Using Scrum for this project isn't an option since that would require a massive amount of meetings that don't make sense for a project with just two people.
The waterfall model seems suitable since the project must be completed within a fixed timeframe.
However, since this project is more conceptual, we only have the project phases of initiation, analysis, design, and construction (of a PoC).

We also don't define any fixed milestones. Instead, we define a project plan in @project_plan that roughly places the phases mentioned above in the time-frame we have available for the project.
We plan specific tasks weekly, maintaining an agile approach.
