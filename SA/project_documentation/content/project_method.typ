= Project Management Method
Using Scrum for this project isn't an option since that would require massive meetings that don't make sense for a project with just two people.
The waterfall model seems to be a suitable base since the project has to be done in a fixed timeframe.
However, since this project is more conceptual, we only have the project phases of initiation, analysis, design, and construction (of a PoC).

We also don't define any fixed milestones. Instead, we define a project plan in @project_plan that roughly places the phases mentioned above in the time-frame we have available for the project.
We plan the specific tasks in the weekly phases, maintaining an agile approach.
