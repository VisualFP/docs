= Project Method
Using Scrum for this project isn't an option for us, since that would create a massive amount of meetings that doesn't make sense for a project with just 2 people.
Since the project has to be done in a fixed timeframe, the waterfall model seems to be a suitable base.
However, since this project is more of a conceptual nature, we only have the project phases initiation, analysis, design and construction (of a PoC).
Also, we don't define any fixed milestones. Instead we defined a project plan in @project_plan that roughly places the phases mentioned above in the time-frame we have available for the project.
We plan the specific tasks in the phases on a weekly basis, maintinging an agile approach.
