= Project Method
We don't use a particular project method in this project.
Using Scrum isn't an option for us, since that would create a massive amount of meetings that doesn't make sense for a project with just 2 people.
Since the project has to be done in a fixed timeframe, the waterfall model seems fitting.
However, since this project is more of a conceptual nature, we only have the project phases initiation, analysis, design and construction (of a PoC).
Also, we don't define any fixed milestones. Instead we defined a project plan in /*@project_plan */that roughly places the phases mentioned above in the time-frame we have available to do the project.
