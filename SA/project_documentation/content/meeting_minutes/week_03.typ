= Project Meeting 03.10.2023 08:15 - 09:00 (MS Teams)
== Participants
- Prof. Dr. Farhad Mehta
- Lukas Streckeisen
- Jann Flepp

== Agenda
- Discussion of vision for prototype
- Decisions:
    - Design concept is the focus of this #ac("SA"), prototype is secondary
    - Design should focus on education, advanced users are secondary
    - Design concept is allowed to be idealistic, implementation in prototype doesn't have to be feasable
- Input from Advisor:
    - Think of concept to visualize FP data types (algebraic datatypes, maybe type classes)
    - Look at https://github.com/jespercockx/agda-lecture-notes/blob/master/agda.pdf for inspiration
    - Send visualization drafts to advisor as soon as they're ready
